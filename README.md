## About This Project

This is an innovative waste management solution built for **Smart India Hackathon 2025** by **Team Smart_Sorters**. Our project leverages AI and machine learning to revolutionize waste classification and management through smart scanning technology.

## Welcome to EcoMitra üå±

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) and enhanced with cutting-edge AI capabilities for waste classification and environmental monitoring.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

## üì± App Structure

The app is organized with the following key directories:

- `app/` - Main application screens and navigation
  - `(auth)/` - Authentication flow (login, register, OTP)
  - `(tabs)/` - Main tab navigation screens
- `components/` - Reusable UI components
- `assets/` - Images, animations, and ML models
- `utils/` - Utility functions and ML processing
- `contexts/` - React contexts for state management

## ü§ñ AI/ML Models

The project includes several machine learning models for waste classification:

- **ONNX Models**: `waste_classifier.onnx`, `model.onnx`
- **TensorFlow Lite**: `model.tflite`
- **YOLOv5**: `yolov5su.onnx` for object detection

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
